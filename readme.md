Murloc_Project is a fictional project I made for practice. It is a basically an e-shop selling Murlocs, little creatures from the fantastical world of WarCraft. 

The website will be responsive and dynamic, meaning it will be accessible to different types of screens and the views will be render dynamically. 

The technology I will be using are as followed : 

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
